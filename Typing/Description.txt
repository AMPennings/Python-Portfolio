This is a GUI I created to assist with learning to Touch Type.
As a programmer, typing is an essential skill which needs to be
constantly maintained and refined. 
However, there are very few services which allow you to practice
touch typing specifically for coding. This is a huge gap
due to the number of special characters required in coding
making it a very different task to normal typing.
At the moment it uses local LLMs to generate either random code
or random text.

In the future I'd be looking at using a better model to generate
the code, and as a stretch goal trying to retrain a simple LLM
to make the text more adversarial to the typer (i.e it tries
to change the text to exploit your weaknesses).
