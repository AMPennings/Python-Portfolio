I've been toying with the idea that alot of documents are
 automatically read by computers.
There are some case where you want to include an image in a
document to give an impression to your human readers,
 but if its just going to be filtered by machines who can't
 interpret the meaning of your graphic, its inclusion
is to your detriment. 

There is of course an easy way around this
Using small text to form images.
 
Unlike the above example, this approach allows the creation
of really unique and interesting graphics, with a distinct
aesthetic. Allowing for your message to be received by both
robots and humans alike.
This is a simple GUI which aims to automate this process.

The Gui allows you to determine the position of the line break,
the number of times the input text is repeated, the font size
and how the Text and backgrounds color are changed from the
 initial image.
